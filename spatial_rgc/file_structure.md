The following directories
- spatial_rgc/data
- spatial_rgc/imaging_scripts/mappings
- spatial_rgc/imaging_scripts/data
- spatial_rgc/imaging_scripts/outputs

must contain subdirectories of the form 140g_rn{X}_rg{Y} where X is the retina number, and Y is the tissue section number of the retina.

For example:
spatial_rgc/data/140g_rn3_rg0 should contain the raw cell by gene matrix for retina 3, tissue section 0 (the first tissue section of that retina).
